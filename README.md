# DigitPrediction
The goal of this project was to develop a model to predict the digit (0-9) based on the pixel values of handwritten digits. The dataset consisted of over 1700 handwritten digits, each with 64 pixel values. Using machine learning modeling techniques, such as knn, decision trees, and random forest, I was able to accurately classify the digits based on their pixel values.

In this project, I developed practical skills in utilizing machine learning algorithms for image recognition tasks. I learned how to perform feature engineering and data preprocessing to build precise and reliable models. The experience highlighted the importance of optimizing and fine-tuning model hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.

I also gained an understanding of the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques to accurately measure model performance. Overall, this project helped me to improve my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning algorithms for image recognition tasks, which I can apply in future projects.
